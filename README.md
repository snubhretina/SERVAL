* SERVAL uses `Client`-`Server` communication. The `Server` performs model inference on input images, while the GUI allows vessel editing, refinement, and parameterization.
* GUI: implemented with MFC and C++
* Server: implemented in Python
* DeepLearning model(Vessel Segmentation / A-V Classification) code is available below.
